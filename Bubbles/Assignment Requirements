Use a Turtle to fill a green circle with a radius of 128.Put it towards the left side of the Turtles' playground.
Fill four more circles to the right of the first one; each circle will have half the radius of the previous circle. Each circle will intersect the previous circle at a single point.
Place Bubbles.java in package cp120.assignments.assignment001.
